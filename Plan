Before writing program:

Brainstorming
- Modified Connect Four (see /Game description)

Schedule
- basic window + game loop by Nov. 13
- UML diagram by Nov. 15
- algorithm by Nov. 18
- actual code by Nov. 21
- fix all bugs in actual code by Nov. 22

Division of labour:
- Sameer: initialize window, design instruction screen + board + game over screen
- Nuzhat: game logic (game loop, user input system, animation rendering, etc.)
- Both: game description (already done), prototype, algorithm + coding (sections relating to our respective tasks)

Prototype
- display instructions to players (LEFT/RIGHT arrow keys to select column, SPACE to drop token, winner has most four-in-a-rows)
- on SPACE pressed, get rid of instruction page and show rectangle with "holes" in 7 x 7 pattern, red token hovering over column 4, and "RED - 0" and "BLUE - 0" on top left corner of screen (0s represent respective players' scores)
- on LEFT/RIGHT pressed, move token left/right to column
- on SPACE pressed, drop into column directly below token (token goes to bottom-most empty slot in column)
- change token colour to blue if last colour was red, change token colour to red if last colour was blue
- repeat last three steps until board is filled
    - if four in a row of one colour, draw border of rounded rectangle around four-in-a-row and colour receives one point
- when done, display winner and play again button
- if play again, start from repeat all steps
